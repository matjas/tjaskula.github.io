# Tomasz Jaskula's blog

This is the code source for the blog hosted at [tjaskula.github.io/Blog](tjaskula.github.io/Blog).

## What this blog is about ?

Software architecture, software craftsmanship, functional languages and mostly F#
are topics dear to my heart. I don't restrict myself to talk only about these
but will pick up topics that are of interest to me :)

I would be happy to take Pull Requests for :

* typos and errors (I'm not native english speaker)
* layout and general look and feel.

I hope you'll enjoy the content !
